## Project Overview
In order to properly solve the issues of Nature's Edge Wildlife and Reptile Rescue, we decided to build them a fully functioning website to replace their current website, which lacks high quality UX (see here: https://www.newrr.org/), and is unable to support their needed tools like an animal database, additional forms, and centralized donation tracking.
We chose to decrease complexity for administrative users at the nonprofit by using forms from JotForm and facilitating donation and donation tracking with GiveButter. We centralize animal database editing and links to relevant form submissions and donating tracking all in one Admin Dashboard, which is accessible by logging in with Oauth. 

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vite + React + Tailwind
- Backend: Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- APIs:
- Cloud Services: AWS S3
- Authorization: Google Oauth
